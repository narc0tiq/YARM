YARM=YARM - Resource Monitor

[mod-description]
YARM=This mod helps you to keep track of your mining sites, with useful data such as the percent mined, and estimated time to depletion.\n\nOriginal author: Octav 'narc' Sandulescu, based on work by drs, jorgenRe, and L0771",

[mod-setting-description]
YARM-ticks-between-checks=When a resource site is being monitored, the amount of resources in it is only updated once every N game ticks (60 ticks = 1 second), based on this value. Increase to hopefully improve UPS, at the cost of needing longer to update a site's estimates.
YARM-entities-per-tick=For resources that are being monitored, this controls how many resource entities (ore tiles) to query in a single tick (1 of the normally 60 updates every second). Reduce this to hopefully improve UPS.
YARM-overlay-step=Adding huge resource patches can cause FPS drop with large overlays.  Changing the sparseness of the overlay will reduce the FPS drop by having less entities. Set to 1 for full coverage, 2 for 1/4, 3 for 1/9, etc.
YARM-map-markers=Show markers on the map containing the site name and its current content, updating automatically. Note: after changing this setting, it may take a few seconds for the results to be visible!
YARM-warn-timeleft=The hours of remaining resources that will alert the player for a single resource site.
YARM-warn-timeleft_totals=The hours of remaining resources that will alert the player for the total lines which are displayed if there are multiple active sites for an ore type.
YARM-order-by=Change the display order of sites in the YARM list.
YARM-debug-profiling=When enabled, outputs some information about tick timing to the player output and factorio-current.log.
YARM-adjust-for-productivity=Amounts are shown adjusted by mining productivity research.
YARM-productivity-show-raw-and-adjusted=Amounts show both raw amount and amount adjusted by mining productivity research, one of them in parentheses (default: show the raw amount in parentheses).
YARM-productivity-parentheses-part-is=Change which amount (raw or adjusted for mining productivity) is shown in parentheses.
YARM-grow-limit=Maximum distance from the original center that a site may grow when it is created. -1 = Unlimited growth. 0 = No growth. More than 0 = Limited growth.
YARM-adjust-over-percentage-sites=When enabled sites will have their "initial amount" set to match the current amount, if the current amount of resources is more than the one noted initially. Can be used as a temporary fix or a permanent check.
YARM-nominal-ups=Deprecation warning:\nThis setting will be removed in a future update. Please reach out in the mod discussion page if you are using this feature and want it to remain!\n\nThe number of updates per second that YARM will assume when calculating ETD and mining speeds. 60 is the default, but if your game is consistently running below the default, adjust this value to your average UPS to get more accurate estimates and speeds.
YARM-make-fake-ores=When enabled, YARM will create a phony item for each resource that, when placed, will create a mineable deposit of that resource. The items cannot be obtained. This is necessary for counting the number of ore entities while dragging the selection tool but may interact badly with other mods (e.g., AAI Programmable Structures) and is thus off by default.
YARM-hud-update-ticks=The HUD (the list of sites and their current status) must be refreshed periodically with information about the existing sites. This controls how often it happens. The value is expressed in ticks (60 ticks = 1 second).
YARM-color-scheme=Pick from one of the built-in color schemes, or choose "custom" to use the settings below to pick your own colors.
YARM-color-from=Will be ignored unless the color scheme above is "Custom".
YARM-color-to=Will be ignored unless the color scheme above is "Custom".
YARM-display-name-format=A custom format used to generate site display names. The name tag (controlled by the rename function) will be appended if not explicitly mentioned in the tags.\n\nThe format consists of fixed text along with [tags], where the tags are replaced by the appropriate site properties.\nKnown tags:\n- [planet]: the planet name\n- [4-way-compass], [8-way-compass], [16-way-compass] for the compass direction from the planet origin in the forms: "N", "NE", "ENE" respectively\n- [distance] for the distance from planet origin\n- [center-xy] for the X,Y coordinates of the site center\n- [index] for the site index (its identity within its force)\n- [ore-icon] and [ore-name] are self-explanatory\n- [name-tag] is the name tag as set by the player (empty)\n- [name-tag-or-index] will show the name tag if one is set, or the site index if not

YARM-color-scheme-custom=When selected, the color pickers below will be used for the ends of the color range (e.g., perhaps green to blue or gray to white may help you better).
