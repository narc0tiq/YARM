[mod-setting-description]
YARM-ticks-between-checks=When a resource site is being monitored, the amount of resources in it is only updated once every N game ticks (60 ticks = 1 second), based on this value. Increase to hopefully improve UPS, at the cost of needing longer to update a site's estimates.
YARM-entities-per-tick=For resources that are being monitored, this controls how many resource entities (ore tiles) to query in a single tick (1 of the normally 60 updates every second). Reduce this to hopefully improve UPS.
YARM-overlay-step=Adding huge resource patches can cause FPS drop with large overlays.  Changing the sparseness of the overlay will reduce the FPS drop by having less entities. Set to 1 for full coverage, 2 for 1/4, 3 for 1/9, etc.
YARM-map-markers=Show markers on the map containing the site name and its current content, updating automatically. Note: after changing this setting, it may take a few seconds for the results to be visible!
YARM-warn-timeleft=The hours of remaining resources that will alert the player.
YARM-order-by=Change the display order of sites in the YARM list.
YARM-site-prefix-with-surface=Prefix the surface name to the site name. Useful for maps with multiple surfaces.
YARM-debug-profiling=When enabled, outputs some information about tick timing to the player output and factorio-current.log.
YARM-adjust-for-productivity=Amounts are shown adjusted by mining productivity research.
YARM-productivity-show-raw-and-adjusted=Amounts show both raw amount and amount adjusted by mining productivity research, one of them in parentheses (default: show the raw amount in parentheses).
YARM-productivity-parentheses-part-is=Change which amount (raw or adjusted for mining productivity) is shown in parentheses.
