YARM-ticks-between-checks= When a resource site is being monitored, the amount of resources in it is only updated once every N game ticks (60 ticks = 1 second), based on this value.
YARM-overlay-step= Adding huge resource patches can cause FPS drop with large overlays.  Changing the sparseness of the overlay will reduce the FPS drop by having less entities. Set to 1 for full coverage, 2 for 1/4, 3 for 1/9, etc.
YARM-warn-percent= The percentage of remaining resources that will alert the player.
YARM-map-markers=Show markers on the map containing the site name and its current content, updating automatically. Note: after changing this setting, it may take a few seconds for the results to be visible!
